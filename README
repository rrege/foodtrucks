For this project, my team and I were tasked with developing a database mated to a user interface. 
The database is created and populated with the initial data and stored procedures with the attached SQL script.
We chose to create a desktop user interface using Python 3.7 and PyQt5, in the attached Python script.

To use the application, first run the SQL script on your computer.
Next, in the Python script, starting on line 2507, input your SQL server credentials. 
Finally, from the command line or your IDE, run the file.
